## Chapter 1: The secretary problem
You have to hire the best secretary for the job. However, once you decline an applicant, they will never work for you. There is always the possibility of a better one just around the corner, but you have to commit at some point. The book recommends to take the most skilled applicant of the first 37% of the applicants as a baseline and hire the next one who exceeds that skill level.
