## Chapter 1: The secretary problem
You have to hire the best secretary for the job. However, once you decline an applicant, they will never work for you. There is always the possibility of a better one just around the corner, but you have to commit at some point. The book recommends to take the most skilled applicant of the first 37% of the applicants as a baseline and hire the next one who exceeds that skill level.

##Chapter 2: Explore/Exploit
Do you go to a good place you have already been to or try out a new place you know nothing about? Both actions have potential benefits or problems. The main arguments in the book are that unexplored places are inherently valuable and that we switch from an explore-heavy strategy when we are young to an exploit-driven strategy when we get older.
